Today, Ray invited me to join him on a ride to Vashon Island and back. Ray
and I met at Jenny & Aseem’s wedding which he happened to officiate. We started
rolling shortly after 8am—I was a bit late as I am still learning that
strapping one’s luggage to the bike takes longer than expected—and headed to
West Seattle to catch the ferry from Fauntleroy to Vashon Island at 9:05am.
I suggested we take the scenic route via Alki Beach and it paid off. Here
are some impressions from our ride:

After Ray left, I saw a ferry employee waving at me by the street entering the
terminal. There was a family of ducks that got stuck on the street because of
the high curb. In a team effort, we corralled all of the ducklings onto the curb
except for one that got away. In an attempt to guide it back to its mom, it fell
into the drainage opening. For a split second I was shocked, but then realized
I was dealing with a duckling that can obviously swim. The ferry employee also
reassured me that the drainage leads to the Puget Sound so it should be fine.
Unfortunately, the duckling didn’t attempt to swim out into the open water, so
the man went to grab some tools and reunited the duckling with its mom:
