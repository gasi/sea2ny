Today, after 60 days and 8166 miles on the road, I have reached Brooklyn, NY. My
journey passed through 24 states, at least half a dozen of National Parks, and I
am grateful to have met so many people on my way. Thank you to all for following
along and staying in touch with me.

Now, I am simply happy to be reunited with my love Shaniece and I look forward
to spending time with her, recovering from my trip, and reflecting on all the
memories I have made.
