Last night, I was so excited that I only slept five hours. This combined with
my need to pick up a few more items before heading out meant I wanted to keep
my first ride short today (safety first!), but more on that later.

The day started with a welcome text message from Leo asking whether we could
grab breakfast before I left. Leo has been kind enough to let me rent a room in
his house during the time since I returned to Seattle. He also rides motorcycles
and understands the passion behind it. It also means he has ample space and all
the necessary tools that allowed me to prepare for my trip — thanks, Leo!

We both had an omelet at
[Café Solstice](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-solstice-seattle-3),
a good way to start a day of riding:

I must have walked by this locksmith (yes, the one behind the [Mystery Coke
Machine](http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mystery-soda-machine)) dozens and
dozens of times while living on Capitol Hill but I never had a need for it until
today when I was looking for a mechanism to lock my helmet and suit to my bike.
Unfortunately, they didn’t have either, but I decided to make a copy of my
ignition key just in case. Believe it or not, that didn’t require any paperwork
and cost me just $4 and change:

When I went downtown switch from AT&T to a Verizon Unlimited plan (which
might come in handy when blogging on the road), I ran into this gentleman.
Robert is homeless and suffers from diabetes. He’s also nifty in how he figured
out how to make free phone calls on Starbuck’s WiFi using Facebook Messenger. He
recommended me to visit the East Beach in Santa Barbara on my way to LA and who
knows, maybe we’ll even run into each other when he goes there on May 17:

Shaniece said I should keep my trusting attitude towards strangers but also
listen to my gut in case the situation calls for it. Therefore, I picked
something up at the Army Surplus Store that I hope I’ll never have to use (but
rather have and not use than the other way around):

Time to pack my bike for the last time in Seattle:

I decided not to rush (safety first!) and catch a later ferry which turned out
to be packed with commuters on motorcycles. Tim (left) also got his license
last summer. He has only missed six days of riding since January — impressive!
Brent (center) shared his experience of owning an Aerostich for 12 years (it
also leaks in the crotch):

Mike saw my bike (he has a BMW R1200GSA) and chatted me up on the ferry. He
shared his passion for offroading and also happens to have picked up the same
set of soft bags from [Mosko Moto](https://moskomoto.com/). In fact, he was such
an early adopter that his 40L duffle bag is missing the pass through for cam
buckles under the tent pole compartment (bummer!):

Originally, I planned to ride to Port Angeles, but luckily I hadn’t booked any
accommodations because two people on the ferry recommended I go to the much more
picturesque Port Townsend instead. After a beautiful ride in the sunshine, I
arrived in Port Townsend around 7pm; my first stop on this journey. It was just
in time for the [Golden
Hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hour_(photography)) and I decided to
stay in a motel to catch up on some much needed sleep so I can feel fresh for
exploring the Olympic Peninsula tomorrow. But before I did, I spent a bit of
time taking some photos around the town and also fly my drone by the waterfront.

Suspicious seagull acting suspicious:

This is what you do when you are hungry and all the places in town are closed,
including the highly recommended pizza place at the water front. All you need is
a coffee maker, a pack of freeze dried _Fettucini Alfredo with Chicken_, and 20
minutes:
